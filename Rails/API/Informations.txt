Routes:

It's possible to restrict routes in the config/routes.rb (Improve memory use and speed up the routing process)

resources :zombies, except: :destroy 
resources :zombies, only: :index

Also possible with tabs 

resources :zombies, except: [:edit, :update] 

You can apply the same rule for multiple object with with_options

with_options only: :index do |list_only|
	list_only.resources :zombies
	list_only.resources :humans 
	...
end 

> rake routes will give you all the routes 

Subdomain:

Keeping our API under its own subdomain allows load balancing traffic at the DNS level

Still in the config/route.rb file

resources :zombies, constraints: { subdomain: 'api' } 
Will be reachable at http://api.domain/zombies

Add a specific namespace for api 
namespace :api, path '/', constraints: { subdomain: 'api' } do
	resources :zombies 
	resources :humans
	...
end

You will need to modify the host file 

127.0.0.1 domain-dev.com
127.0.0.1 api.domain-dev.com
