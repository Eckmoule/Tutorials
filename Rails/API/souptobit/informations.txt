 We can make tests looks better in the console with minitest (in test_helper.rb). 



First funtionality list books 

> rails g integration_test listing_books
# Write test listing books
# Make it work:
- Configure route in routes.rb
- Create a bookcontroller
# Add to the test an assert to the number of books and the setup (think about the model you want)
# Make it work
> rails g model book title rating:integer --no-fixture (to avoid confusion in testing we remove the fixture)
> rake db:migrate
- Modify books_controller

#Add books inside the seed (db)
> rake db:seed

#Restricts the routes

#Add a filter by rating
- Write an integration test 
- Adapt book controller 

#Add an end point for finished books
> rails g integration_test listing_finished_books
- Write specific test for json and xml
- Add the routes
- Add the controller 
- Add the finished_at property to the object 
> rails g migration add_finished_at_to_books finished_at:datetime
> rake db:migrate (rails_env=test)
- Write a scope inside the book model to avoid having request in the controller

#Create a book 
> rails g integration_test creating_books
- Write valid creation test
- Adapt controller to make it worked 
- Write an invalid creation test
- Adapt controller to make it worked (adapt model to validates fields)
