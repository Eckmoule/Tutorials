Check versions
> ruby --version
> rails --version

Create the rails app
> rails new ReadingList

Uncomment debuger gem in GemFile + run bundle command

Check 
> rails s (+ go to localhost:3000)

Create db (config db mysql with database.yml)
> rake db:create
> rake db:migrate

Initialize git 

 > git init (check .gitignore should ignore the logs, /tmp, .SQLite database, /.bundle) 

 We can make tests looks better in the console with minitest (in test_helper.rb). 



First funtionality list books 

> rails g integration_test listing_books
# Write test listing books
# Make it work:
- Configure route in routes.rb
- Create a bookcontroller
# Add to the test an assert to the number of books and the setup (think about the model you want)
# Make it work
> rails g model book title rating:integer --no-fixture (to avoid confusion in testing we remove the fixture)
